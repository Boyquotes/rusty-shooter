//! Game uses message passing mechanism to perform specific actions. For example to spawn
//! a bot or item everything you need is to send appropriate message and level will create
//! required entity. This is very effective decoupling mechanism that works perfectly with
//! strict ownership rules of Rust.
//!
//! Each message can be handle in multiple "systems", for example when bot dies, leader board
//! detects it and counts deaths of bot and adds one frag to a killer (if any). This way leader
//! board know nothing about bots, it just knows the fact that bot died. In other way bot knows
//! nothing about leader board - its can just die. Not sure if this mechanism is suitable for
//! all kinds of games, but at least it very useful for first-person shooters.
